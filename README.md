# Python solutions for Euler-project problems
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems (...)". These problems got my attention a while back. For fun, I spent some spare time solving a few of the problems, for which I've posted my solutions here.

Please find a list of the problems on the: [Euler-project page](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
